    <h1>Using the AWS Persistence Framework for Core Data</h1>

    <p>This article discusses a new framework that works with the AWS SDK for iOS to allow apps to
            use Amazon DynamoDB as a persistent back-end for the Apple Core Data Framework. The
            article assumes familiarity with both technologies. If you haven't done so already,
            please review the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/articles/7439603059327617">User
                Preferences sample app</a> to familiarize yourself with using Amazon DynamoDB with
            the AWS SDK for iOS. You should also review Apples's <a
                href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/iPhoneCoreData01/Introduction/Introduction.html"
                >Core Data Introduction</a>. </p>
    <p>The Apple Core Data Framework provides generalized and automated solutions to
            common tasks associated with object life-cycle and object graph management, including
            persistence. You can read more about Core Data in the Apple documentation <a
                href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/iPhoneCoreData01/Introduction/Introduction.html"
                >here</a>
        </p>

    <p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a> is a fast, highly scalable,
            highly available, cost-effective, non-relational database service. Amazon DynamoDB
            removes traditional scalability limitations on data storage while maintaining low
            latency and predictable performance. </p>

    

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This sample app is based on Apple's example iOS Core Data app, <a
                href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/Locations/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40008406"
                >Locations</a>. Our version adds another entity to capture checkins at a particular
            location and adds a relationship between the two entities. Finally, we use the AWS
            Persistence Framework for Core Data to allow our app to save the entities to Amazon
            DynamoDB. </p>

    <h2>Entity and Relationship Model</h2>
    <p><img alt="Core Data - Model" src="CoreData-Model.png" /><br />Where the Locations example
            from Apple has only a single entity, our version expands the model to have two entities,
                <i>Location</i> and <i>Checkin</i>, with a 1-to-many relationship between
                them.<br /><b>Note:</b> The AWS Persistence Framework for Core Data has been tested
            with 1-to-1 and 1-to-many relationships.</p>
    

    <p><img alt="Core Data - Location" src="CoreData-Location.png" /><br />
            <img alt="Core Data - Checkin" src="CoreData-Checkin.png" /><br />For each object, we
            defined the property types to correspond to an appropriate Core Data
                type.<br /><b>Note:</b> The AWS Persistence Framework for Core Data supports String,
            Numeric (Integer 16/32/64, Decimal, Double, and Float), Date, and Boolean types. For
            properties that are hash keys, only String and Numeric types are supported. Primitives
            are not supported as entity properties.</p>
    
        <h2>Configuring the AWS Persistence Framework for Core Data</h2>
    <p>Given this entity and relationship model, you need to configure the app to use the AWS
            Persistence Framework for Core Data. </p>

    <p>The AppDelegate also implements the
                <code>AWSPersistenceDynamoDBIncrementalStoreDelegate</code> protocol, which requires
            you to implement a single selector: </p>

    <table class="sample"><tr><td align="left"
                    ><pre>- (AmazonCredentials *)credentials
{
    return [AmazonClientManager credentials];
}   </pre>
                </td></tr>
    </table>
    

    <p><b>Note:</b> This selector is called every time the framework requires a connection to Amazon
            DynamoDB; it should return valid credentials. The supplied sample uses TVM to gather
            these credentials. </p>

    <p>The next step is to register that you want to use Amazon DynamoDB as your back-end store.
            This happens in your AppDelegate as part of the <code>persistentStoreCoordinator</code>
            selector. </p>

    <table class="sample"><tr><td align="left"
                    ><pre>[NSPersistentStoreCoordinator registerStoreClass:[AWSPersistenceDynamoDBIncrementalStore class] forStoreType:AWSPersistenceDynamoDBIncrementalStoreType];
    
persistentStoreCoordinator = [[NSPersistentStoreCoordinator alloc] initWithManagedObjectModel:[self managedObjectModel]];    </pre></td></tr>
    </table>
    

    <p>Next, you need to create a number of mappings to allow the framework to understand how to
            handle your managed objects. These include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hash keys for each table in Amazon DynamoDB that is being
    used to represent an entity.

<table class="sample"><tr><td align="left"
                            ><pre>NSDictionary *hashKeys = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                          @"locationId", @"Location", 
                          @"checkinId", @"Checkin", nil];</pre>
                        </td></tr>
</table>

      </li>
      <li>Attribute to use in each table to represent the
    <code>version</code> of the object being stored.

<table class="sample"><tr><td align="left"
                            ><pre>NSDictionary *versions = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                          @"version", @"Location", 
                          @"version", @"Checkin", nil];</pre>
                        </td></tr>
</table>
      </li>
      <li>(Optionally) Table name to use for entities.  By default, the
    entity name is used.

<table class="sample"><tr><td align="left"
                            ><pre>NSDictionary *tableMapper = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                             @"AWS-Locations", @"Location",
                             @"AWS-Checkins", @"Checkin", nil];</pre></td></tr>
</table>

      </li>
    </ul>

<p>With the mappings created, you next create a larger options dictionary and include the delegate
            for your object manager, which is set to be the AppDelegate itself. </p>

    <table class="sample"><tr><td align="left"
                    ><pre>NSDictionary *options = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                         hashKeys, AWSPersistenceDynamoDBHashKey, 
                         versions, AWSPersistenceDynamoDBVersionKey,
                         self, AWSPersistenceDynamoDBDelegate,
                         tableMapper, AWSPersistenceDynamoDBTableMapper, nil];    </pre>
                </td></tr>
    </table>
    

    <p>Finally, you pass the options dictionary to the persistence store coordinator and check for
            errors. </p>

    <table class="sample"><tr><td align="left"
                    ><pre>if(![persistentStoreCoordinator addPersistentStoreWithType:AWSPersistenceDynamoDBIncrementalStoreType 
                                             configuration:nil 
                                                       URL:nil 
                                                   options:options 
                                                     error:&amp;error])
{
    // Handle the error.
    NSLog(@"error: %@", error);
}    </pre></td></tr>
    </table>
    

    <h2>Fetching Managed Objects</h2>
    <p>When fetching objects in Core Data, you create an instance of the <code>NSFetchRequest</code>
            class and specify the type of entity you are fetching: </p>


    <table class="sample"><tr><td align="left"
                    ><pre>NSFetchRequest *request = [[[NSFetchRequest alloc] init] autorelease];
NSEntityDescription *entity = [NSEntityDescription entityForName:@"Location" inManagedObjectContext:managedObjectContext];
[request setEntity:entity];    </pre>
                </td></tr>
    </table>
    

    <p>While it is not shown in our sample app, you can also specify an <code>NSPredicate</code> to
            your <code>NSFetchRequest</code> to restrict the entities returned. In the initial beta
            release of the AWS Persistence Framework for Core Data, <code>NSPredicate</code> is
            supported only for hash key properties.<br /><b>Note:</b> Fetching without a predicate
            will execute as many scan operations as necessary to load the entire contents of the
            underlying Amazon DynamoDB table. </p>

    <p>Once you've created your fetch request, you ask your managed object context to run it and
            return the results. You can then work with the returned array as you normally would. </p>

    <table class="sample"><tr><td align="left"
                    ><pre>NSArray *fetchedResults = [managedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:request error:&amp;error];
NSMutableArray *mutableFetchResults = [fetchedResults mutableCopy];</pre></td></tr>
    </table>
    
    
    <h2>Creating/Saving/Deleting Managed Objects</h2>
    <p>When creating new objects in Core Data, you must request they be created from the managed
            object context. After the object has been created, you can interact with it normally,
            setting properties on the object. </p>
   
    <table class="sample"><tr><td align="left"
                    ><pre>Checkin *checkin = (Checkin *)[NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@"Checkin" inManagedObjectContext:managedObjectContext];
checkin.checkinId = [Utilities getUUID];
checkin.checkinTime = [NSDate date];
checkin.comment = @"First Checkin";    </pre></td></tr>
    </table>
    

    <p>Making changes to managed objects does not cause them to be persisted until the application
            makes a call to explicitly save the changes.<br /><b>Note:</b> This saves any and all
            changes to managed objects created or modified during this session or since the previous
            save. </p>

    <table class="sample"><tr><td align="left"
                    ><pre>NSError *error;
if (![managedObjectContext save:&amp;error])
{
    // Handle the error.
    NSLog(@"error: %@", error);
}    </pre></td></tr>
    </table>
    

    <p>The app can also choose to <i>undo</i> changes.<br /><b>Note:</b> It is possible to undo
            persisted changes made during the current session, but you'll need to save the undo. </p>

    <table class="sample"><tr><td align="left"><pre>[[[self managedObjectContext] undoManager] undo];    </pre>
                </td></tr>
    </table>
    

    <p>Deleting objects also requires notifying the managed object context. You cannot remove
            objects from the back-end store until you've saved the changes. </p>

    <table class="sample"><tr><td align="left"><pre>[managedObjectContext deleteObject:locToDelete];    </pre>
                </td></tr>
    </table>
    
    <h2>Conflict Management</h2>
    
    <p>When using the AWS Persistence Framework for Core Data on multiple threads or devices, you
            may encounter a situation where you need to resolve inconsistencies between data on
            Amazon DynamoDB tables and your local copy in memory. When the conflicts are detected,
            <code>NSManagedObjectContext</code> returns an <code>NSError</code> object and your 
            change will not be persisted. You can change this behavior by setting a merge policy 
            to your <code>NSManagedObjectContext</code>:</p>
    <table
    class="sample"><tr><td align="left"
                    ><pre>managedObjectContext.mergePolicy = [[[NSMergePolicy alloc] initWithMergeType:NSMergeByPropertyStoreTrumpMergePolicyType] autorelease];</pre>
                </td></tr></table>
    
    <p>There are five NSMergePolicyTypes available: <code>NSErrorMergePolicyType</code>
        (default), <code>NSMergeByPropertyStoreTrumpMergePolicyType</code>,
        <code>NSMergeByPropertyObjectTrumpMergePolicyType</code>, <code>NSOverwriteMergePolicyType</code>, and
        <code>NSRollbackMergePolicyType</code>. The AWS Persistence Framework for Core Data can
    handle all five merge policy types. For more information about
    <code>NSMergePolicy</code>, please read <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreData/Reference/NSMergePolicy_Class/Reference/Reference.html">NSMergePolicy Class Reference</a>.</p>

    <p>Because <code>NSManagedObject</code> instances returned by Core Data are lazily loaded, it is
            possible that when you access an attribute of an object, the actual row in the Amazon
            DynamoDB table has been already deleted. In this situation, the AWS Persistence
            Framework for Core Data will return an empty <code>NSManagedObject</code> (the accessor
            will return nil) and sends out
                <code>AWSPersistenceDynamoDBObjectDeletedNotification</code>. You can register to
            observe <code>AWSPersistenceDynamoDBObjectDeletedNotification</code> by calling the
            following method: </p>
<table class="sample"><tr><td align="left"
                    ><pre>[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self
	selector:@selector(mergeDeletedObject:)
	name:AWSPersistenceDynamoDBObjectDeletedNotification
	object:nil];</pre>
                </td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>When you receive the notification, you should remove any invalid objects from local cache and
            refresh the <code>NSManagedObject</code> instance as necessary. The notification object
            has a <code>userInfo</code> dictionary, which you can use to identify the deleted
            object, containing: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hash key of the deleted object with <code>AWSPersistenceDynamoDBObjectDeletedNotificationHashKey</code> key</li>
        <li>Entity name of the deleted object with <code>AWSPersistenceDynamoDBObjectDeletedNotificationEntityName</code> key</li>
        <li><code>NSManagedObjectID</code> of the deleted object with <code>AWSPersistenceDynamoDBObjectDeletedNotificationObjectID</code> key</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following line shows how to refresh an <code>NSManagedObject</code>. Please note that
            refreshing an <code>NSManagedObject</code> will send a getItem request to the Amazon
            DynamoDB. </p>
    <table class="sample"><tr><td align="left"><pre>[managedObjectContext refreshObject:managedObject mergeChanges:YES];</pre>
                </td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>Under heavily concurrent environments, periodically calling the <code>refreshObject</code>
            method may reduce inconsistent states. Also, calling the <code>refreshObject</code>
            method before saving the change will minimize inconsistent states to be persisted to the
            Amazon DynamoDB tables. </p>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>Although the AWS Persistence Framework for Core Data was developed to meet the widest use
            case possible, it does have certain limitations. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>iOS versions prior to 5.0 are not supported by the AWS Persistence Framework for Core Data.</li>
      <li>You cannot modify the hash key attribute once the object has been
      persisted to the Amazon DynamoDB table. Please delete the object and
      insert a new object instead of changing the hash key. When hash key
      attributes are modified, the save operation will fail and return an
      <code>NSError</code> object.</li>
      <li>Primitives are not supported as properties for entities. When
      generating your <code>NSManagedObject</code> subclasses, make sure this
      option is not enabled.</li>
      <li>For properties that are mapped to hash keys for the entities, only
    string and numeric (Integer 16/32/64, Decimal, Double, and Float) types are supported.</li>
      <li>For all other properties, it is possible to use Date and
    Boolean types as well as the already mentioned string and numeric
    types.</li>
      <li>Only 1-to-1 and 1-to-many relationships between entities are supported.</li>
      <li>The framework handles creating, modifying, and deleting rows
    in the underlying Amazon DynamoDB tables, but it does not manage the tables
    themselves. You must create tables using primitives provided by
    the AWS SDK for iOS or via the AWS Management Console.</li>
      <li>When fetching objects without a predicate, the framework
    will potentially do multiple scan operations against Amazon DynamoDB, which will use large
    amounts of your provisioned read throughput.  Using a predicate when
    fetching uses a get request against Amazon DynamoDB, which
    uses only the throughput necessary to load the single object.</li>
      <li>With the current version of the framework, <code>NSPredicates</code> are
    limited to only the properties that are mapped to hash keys.</li>
      <li>Save operations are not guaranteed to be transactional. You should check the errors that
                Core Data returns and formulate your handling strategies assuming partial data might
                have been persisted to DynamoDB tables.</li>
      <li>When doing fetches of all objects in a table, the AWS Persistence Framework for Core Data
                cannot guarantee that recent objects inserts and deletes will be reflected due to
                inconsistent read status. </li>
      <li>The Persistence Framework does not support sorting because the Amazon
      DynamoDB scan operation does not sort the result. However, Apple's <a
      href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/CoreDataFramework/Classes/NSManagedObjectContext_Class/NSManagedObjectContext.html">NSManagementObjectContext
      Class Reference</a> states that "if you fetch some objects, work with
      them, and then execute a new fetch that includes a superset of those
      objects, you do not get new instances or update data for the existing
      objects-you get the existing objects with their current in-memory state."
      In this situation, Core Data may sort the in-memory objects based on the
      sort descriptors provided. However, we don't recommend relying on this
      behavior; instead, you should sort the results in memory when the objects
      need to be sorted.</li>
      <li>With the current version of the framework, NSPredicates are limited
	to only the properties that are mapped to hash keys. Also, when using
	the framework, your query can specify only one hashKey and only one
	possible value for that hashKey. Some examples are shown below:
	    <table style="border-collapse:collapse;border:1px solid black;">
		<tr>
		    <td style="border:1px solid black;">
		"hashKey1=value1"</td>
		    <td style="border:1px solid black;">
		supported, one hashKey and one value</td> </tr> <tr>
		    <td style="border:1px solid black;">
		"hashKey1 = value1 OR hashkey1 = value2"</td>
		    <td style="border:1px solid black;">
		not supported, one haskKey, but two values</td> </tr> <tr>
		    <td style="border:1px solid black;">
		"hashKey1 IN (value1, value2)"</td>
		    <td style="border:1px solid black;">
		not supported, one haskKey, but two values</td> </tr>
	    </table>
      </li>
    </ul>
